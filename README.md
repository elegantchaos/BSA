# BSA

Swift support for Bethesda's BSA file format, as used by Skyrim, Fallout, etc.

Currently this version of the code supports version 105, as used by Skyrim SE/AE. 

Support for earlier versions may be added at some later date. 

## Here Be Dragons

This is an early version, and it currently only supports extracting a `.bsa` file to a directory.

More coming eventually.
